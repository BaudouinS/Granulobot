tasklist = """

Full Task List:

* Commandinterface (UDP)
  * Basic setup with existing parts:
    ./ Add files: Agentparent, Interparent, Userinter, Configagent
    ./ Add interfaces and agents: Userinter, configagent
  * Make telemetry agent - get (gets telemetry into memory)
    * commlist (ip, last entry, MAC) varlist (acc, vel, motor settings) - all configurable
    * On startup check if read is running (after 1s delay) and report error if not.
  * Send command agent - send robotId command
  * Add Socket interface and web interface
  * Config agent: make better all command
  * Config agent: run through all commands and bugcheck
* Manual
  * How to run telemetry and command program(s)
  * How to use simple gui
  * How to run write a program to run the robots (what is interface and how to use it)
* Library:
  * Read from tele (can have robot ID for one robot)
  * Write to comm (returns error message)
  * Write log message (sender, level, message) - can I use logging for this?
* Telemetry
  * Thread to log messages (UDP)
  * Make sure subthreads die after 1s if no data (crash with error from timeout?)
  * Logging set up for less messages in terminal
  
DONE:
./ Testrobot: prog that sends string NHz and listens on port to receive messages
  ./ Set up program
  ./ Get config (use library)
  ./ Set ports
  ./ Run delay
  ./ Report telemetry
  ./ Check for commands
* Telemetry
  ./ Basic loop setup and memory for messages: Dict, open file
  ./ Set up configuration ports and stuffs
  ./ Thread function to read from robots
    ./ add detection of IP address and add to message
    ./ Make it deamon so off when shutodwn
  ./ Thread for respond to telequerry
    ./ make new thread for each connection to avoid blocking main program
  ./ Exit if prompted from telequerry
  ./ Connect real robot
  ./ Decision: Put command into telemetry program different threads
  ./ Design have commloop and commhandle for commands to the bots
  ./ Add local logging: setting up and send info to file and screen
* Library
  ./ Open config (also accepts multiple configs - see HAWC and loads envars)
* Configs:
  ./ Make baseconfig and delta config
