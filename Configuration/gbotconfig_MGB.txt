Full Task List:

./ Testrobot: prog that sends string NHz and listens on port to receive messages
  ./ Set up program
  ./ Get config (use library)
  ./ Set ports
  ./ Run delay
  ./ Report telemetry
  ./ Check for commands
* Telemetry
  ./ Basic loop setup and memory for messages: Dict, open file
  ./ Set up configuration ports and stuffs
  ./ Thread function to read from robots
    ./ add detection of IP address and add to message
    ./ Make it deamon so off when shutodwn
  ./ Thread for respond to telequerry
    ./ make new thread for each connection to avoid blocking main program
  * Make sure subthreads die after 1s if no data (crash with error from timeout?)
  ./ Exit if prompted from telequerry
  * Connect real robot
  * Add logging
* Commandinterface
  * Basic setup with existing parts:
    * Add files: Agentparent, Interparent, Userinter, Socketinter, Webinter, Logctrl, Configagent
    * Add interfaces and agents: Userinter, socketinger, configagent
  * Make telemetry agent - get (gets telemetry into memory)
    * commlist (ip, last entry, MAC) varlist (acc, vel, motor settings) - all configurable
    * On startup check if read is running (after 1s delay) and report error if not.
  * Send command agent - send robotId command
* Library:
  ./ Open config (also accepts multiple configs - see HAWC and loads envars)
  * Read from tele (can have robot ID for one robot)
  * Write to comm (returns error message)
  * Write log message (sender, level, message) - can I use logging for this?
* Send command
  * Basic loop setup
  * Thread to log messages (UDP)
  * Thread to respond to commands
  * Exit if prompted by command message
