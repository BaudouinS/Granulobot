#### Full Task List ####

* Documentation
  * ICD between the programs and gbot_telemetry
  * How to write a program to run the robots (what is interface and how to use it)
* Telemetry
  * Thread to log messages (UDP)
  * Make sure subthreads die after 1s if no data (crash with error from timeout?)
  * Logging set up for less messages in terminal (INFO in terminal but DEBUG in file)
* Commandinterface (UDP)
  * On startup check if telemetry is running (after 1s delay) and report error if not.
  * Add Socket interface and (simple) web interface
  * Userinterface: allow uparrow for last cmd, allow getting messages while writing (look at vtcode)
    * google how to do it (as terminal UI), if needed uset getch() equivalent and micromanage
    ==>> Put gettele and sendcmd into library
  * Config agent: make better all commands
  * Config agent: run through all commands and bugcheck
  * Telemetry and command agent: add timeouts and error catch if things go bad
    * I.e. telecmd program not running, not answering
  * For telemetry agent: flexible commands commlist (ip, last entry, MAC) varlist (acc, vel, motor settings)
  * For telemetry agent: get 1 message from robot every seconds for 10s or so
  * For command agent: Send message to all robots (maybe make this gbots_telemetry functionality)
* Library:
  * Write log message (sender, level, message) - can I use logging for this?
  
DONE:
# Testrobot: prog that sends string NHz and listens on port to receive messages
  ./ Set up program
  ./ Get config (use library)
  ./ Set ports
  ./ Run delay
  ./ Report telemetry
  ./ Check for commands
# Telemetry
  ./ Basic loop setup and memory for messages: Dict, open file
  ./ Set up configuration ports and stuffs
  ./ Thread function to read from robots
    ./ add detection of IP address and add to message
    ./ Make it deamon so off when shutodwn
  ./ Thread for respond to telequerry
    ./ make new thread for each connection to avoid blocking main program
  ./ Exit if prompted from telequerry
  ./ Connect real robot
  ./ Decision: Put command into telemetry program different threads
  ./ Design have commloop and commhandle for commands to the bots
  ./ Add local logging: setting up and send info to file and screen
# Library
  ./ Open config (also accepts multiple configs - see HAWC and loads envars)
  ./ Read from tele (can have robot ID for one robot)
  ./ Write to comm (returns error message)
# Configs:
  ./ Make baseconfig and delta config
# Command Interface:
  ./ Basic setup with existing parts:
    ./ Add files: Agentparent, Interparent, Userinter, Configagent
    ./ Add interfaces and agents: Userinter, configagent
  ./ Make telemetry agent - get (gets telemetry into memory)
    ./ setup basic agenst
    ./ add command for one robot only
  ./ Send command agent - send robotId command
# Documentation
  ./ How to run telemetry and command program(s)
    ./ What to focus on in config file
  ./ How to use simple gui - or at least how to get help on running it.
# Other Issues
  ./ Update for internal AF_INET instead of AF_UNIX - to make windows compatible
    It "seems" to work but without a good windows computer I can't test it.
    ./ Change the relevant code in telemetry - test run
      ./ New keywords: NONE: We use comsock for port, telesock for port and 127.0.0.1.
    ./ In interface move the tele and comm code to utils and change it there.
    QUESTION: Keep other interface code avialable if I need to change it back?
              A: NO I can always look up old code on github and since it's only in
                 telemetry and the library it will be easy to change.
